<p>If you&#39;ve been accepted to PennApps Fall 2015 from another school, please refer to the guidelines below when purchasing travel tickets:</p>
<h2 id="many-schools-will-have-busses">Many schools will have busses</h2>
<p>We will provide buses to and from many schools. If we are sending a bus to your area, your &quot;Travel Method&quot; will be listed as &quot;Chartered Bus&quot; and your &quot;Travel Cap&quot; as $0. A local campus rep will reach out to you regarding the bus departure times.</p>
<h2 id="book-your-travel-asap">Book Your Travel ASAP</h2>
<p>You will have 5 days to RSVP and upload your receipts and forms from the day you receive your acceptance email. <strong>After this period, your admission offer and reimbusment will be recinded.</strong></p>
<p>For every travel region, we&#39;ve done research to find average prices for reimbursable travel that will have you here for the entire event. <strong>We will only reimburse you up to this amount.</strong></p>
<p>If you research transportation from your location and find the travel cap to be unreasonable, feel free to contest it with us by emailing travel@pennapps.com.</p>
<h2 id="dates-and-times">Dates and Times</h2>
<p>You should anticipate arriving by <strong>4 PM Friday, September 4th</strong> and leaving after <strong>5 PM on Sunday, September 6th</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="staying-sunday-night">Staying Sunday Night</h3>
<p>If you cannot book travel for Sunday night and need to leave monday morning, we will try to find a place for you to sleep on campus. Making your own plans (such as staying with a Penn friend) is also encouraged.</p>
<h3 id="unusual-travel-plans">Unusual Travel Plans</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <strong>we will not cover any costs exceeding the budget</strong> we&#39;ve provided for you. You will need to pay any additional costs associated with alternate travel reservations, such as leaving late on Friday to avoid missing a class.</p>
<h2 id="getting-to-the-event">Getting to the event</h2>
<p>To help keep our reimbursment process simple, and get you reimbursments faster, <strong>we will not be paying for transportation from the airport or train station to campus</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="airport">Airport</h3>
<p>The cheapest way to get to campus from the airport is SEPTAâ€™s Airport Line Regional Rail (currently an $8 ticket). A Taxi costs $35 and UberX is $45.</p>
<h3 id="train">Train</h3>
<p>The 30th Street train station is a few blocks from campus and is easily walkable. </p>
<h2 id="drive-if-you-can-">Drive if you can!</h2>
<p>It&#39;s generally a cheaper and more convenient option, particularly if a few hackers carpool together. We will pay for gas and help you find a place to park.</p>
<h2 id="we-process-a-lot-of-reimbusements-help-us-help-you">We process a lot of reimbusements -- help us help you</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please make sure your receipts clearly show the dollar amount spent. </li>
<li>If your tickets can only be purchased on the day of the event (SEPTA, NJTransit, Cab, Uber etc) then you will be permitted to submit your forms after the event.</li>
<li>If you know other people who have been accepted to PennApps coming from the same location, it would be advantageous to have one person book the tickets for everyone. This will make the travel reimbursement process easier. If possible, have this person be an US citizen.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-details">Other Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once you have made your booking, we will not cover any change fees.</li>
<li>We will not cover any unnecessary travel fees, such as an upgrade to business class, food bought on the plane, et cetera.</li>
</ul>
