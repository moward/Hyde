<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment can include any behavior that makes another person feel targeted or uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>As this is a hackathon we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subjective to the anti-harassment policy.</p>
<p>Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing, uniforms, or costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.</p>
<p>Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact event security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organizers may take whatever action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon, or witholding reimbursements.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the hackathon, workshop venues, and hackathon-related social events. </p>
<p><em>Our code of conduct is based on the <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org/">Hack Code of Conduct</a>.</em></p>
