[Beaker Notebook](http://beakernotebook.com) is a new open source tool for collaborative data science. Beaker has an innovative UI and unique architecture to make it easier for novices to get started, and enable experts to work faster. Like IPython, Beaker uses a notebook-based UI metaphor, but Beaker was designed to be polyglot from the ground up. That is, a single notebook may contain cells from multiple different languages that communicate with one another through a unique feature called autotranslation.
