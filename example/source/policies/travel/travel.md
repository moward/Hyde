Traveling to PennApps?
=======================
If you've been accepted to PennApps Fall 2015 from another school, please refer to the guidelines below when purchasing travel tickets:

 - You will have 5 days to RSVP and upload your receipts and forms from the day you receive your acceptance email. If you fail to upload your receipts and forms before the deadline, we will not provide travel reimbursement for you and we will offer your spot to another hacker.
 - Please make sure your receipts clearly show the dollar amount spent. 
 - If your tickets can only be purchased on the day of the event (SEPTA, NJTransit, Cab, Uber etc) then you will be permitted to submit your forms after the event.
 - We are only reimbursing the cheapest form of transport to Philly that we’ve deemed convenient. Please refer the “Travel Method” section of your application for the cheapest form we have found. If you find anything cheaper, please book that!
 - Purchase your ticket as soon as possible. Note that we will only reimburse up to the price provided in the “Travel Cap” section. The longer you wait to book your tickets, the more the prices will go up.
 - Once you have made your booking, we will not cover any change fees.
 - We will not cover any unnecessary travel fees, such as an upgrade to business class, food bought on the plane, et cetera.
 - If you know other people who have been accepted to PennApps coming from the same location, it would be advantageous to have one person book the tickets for everyone. This will make the travel reimbursement process easier. If possible, have this person be an US citizen.
 - We will not cover the cost of transportation to/from the PHL airport or train station. The 30th Street train station is a few blocks from the hacking location and should be walkable. The cheapest way to get to campus from the airport is SEPTA’s Airport Line Regional Rail (currently an $8 ticket).
 - If you need to make unusual travel reservations, such as leaving late on Friday to avoid missing a class, we will not cover any fees exceeding the budget indicated that you may incur.
 - You should anticipate arriving by 4 PM on Friday, January 16th and leaving after 5 PM on Sunday, January 18th. If you cannot book travel for Sunday night, we will try to find a place for you to sleep that night so you can leave Monday morning. You should absolutely try to find accommodations on your own if possible (such as staying with a Penn friend).
 - We will provide buses to and from some schools. If we are sending a bus to your area, your "Travel Method" will be listed as "Chartered Bus" and your "Travel Cap" as $0.
 - Drive if you can! It's generally a cheaper and more convenient option, particularly if a few hackers carpool together. We will pay for gas and help you find a place to park.
 - If you research transportation from your location and find the travel cap to be unreasonable, feel free to contest it with us by emailing travel@pennapps.com.
